# Exercises 006

This time we've decided to give you the exciting challenge of _writing your own tests_. This is a really important skill to practice as generally in industry you will be writing your own tests to ensure code works as expected.

Tests also serve as great documentation to other developers about how your code should behave and the intention of your code. 📝

First, watch the following video:

[Writing your own Unit Tests](https://storage.googleapis.com/tech-returners-course/JavaScript_Challenges/unit_testing.mp4)

Then, work through the exercises in a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach of Red -> Green -> Refactor.

⚠️ Be careful to ensure your test cases cover a range of possible eventualities! For example, if you just test the numbers `2`, `3` and `4` for `isPrime` can you be sure that your function is actually correct?
